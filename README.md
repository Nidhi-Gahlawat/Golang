## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple example of Go programming concepts and highlight the testing capabilities using the `myutil` package. 
It covers basic Go syntax, control flow, data types, and more.

## Installation

To use this project, ensure that you have Go installed on your machine. Follow the official Go installation guide for your operating system: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Once Go is installed, you can clone this repository using Git:

```shell
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can explore the code and run the example programs. Here's how to get started:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd <golang-folder-path>
   ```

2. Build and run the `main.go` file:

   ```shell
   go run main.go
   ```

   This will execute the example code showcasing various Go programming concepts.

3. Modify the code as per your requirements and experiment with different functionalities of the `myutil` package.

## Testing

This repository includes a set of tests for the `myutil` package to demonstrate how to write unit tests in Go. The tests are located in the `myutil_test.go` file.

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd <golang-folder-path>/myutils
   ```

2. Run the tests using the `go test` command:

   ```shell
   go test
   ```

   Go will execute the tests and display the test results, including any failures or errors.

Feel free to explore the test file and modify the tests to suit your needs. Writing tests is an essential part of ensuring the correctness and reliability of your Go code.
